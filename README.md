Voting Contract on Soroban Blockchain

This project implements a simple voting smart contract on the Soroban blockchain using Rust. Users can interact with the contract to record their votes for different options, and the contract maintains a tally of the votes.

Features:

Voting: Users can record their votes for different options.
View Poll Results: Users can view the current tally of votes for each option.
Error Handling: The contract handles errors gracefully and prevents invalid votes.
Getting Started:

Install Rust:
Ensure that you have Rust installed on your system. You can install Rust by following the instructions on rustup.rs.

Install Soroban SDK:
This project uses the Soroban SDK for smart contract development. Install the Soroban SDK by following the instructions in the official documentation.

Deploy Contract:
After implementing and testing your contract locally, you can deploy it to the Soroban blockchain. Follow the deployment instructions provided in the Soroban SDK documentation.

Interact with Contract:
Once deployed, users can interact with the contract using a suitable client or frontend application. Provide users with the necessary information to access and interact with the contract.

Usage:

Recording Votes:
Users can record their votes for different options by specifying the number of votes for each option and clicking the "Record Votes" button.

Viewing Poll Results:
Users can view the current tally of votes for each option to track the progress of the poll.

Frontend:

The frontend of the project provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the contract. It is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Follow the instructions in the README to set up and deploy the frontend application.

Contributing:

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute to the project, please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. Ensure that your code follows the project's coding standards and conventions.
